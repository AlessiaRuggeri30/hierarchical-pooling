# Hierarchical Pooling
## Geometric Deep Learning, course project - USI, 2019
*Alessia Ruggeri*

This project was implemented as a university project for the course of *Geometric Deep Learning* at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.

Implemenation of the paper *Towards Sparse Hierarchical Graph Classifier* tested on Enzymes, D&D, Proteins and Collab datasets using Tensorflow 2.0.

Read the `Report.pdf` file for an in-depht description of the project, of the model and of the results obtained.
