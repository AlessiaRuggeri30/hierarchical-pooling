*Alessia Ruggeri*

**WARNING: Work in progress**

This project was implemented as a university project for the course of *Geometric Deep Learning* at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.

Implemenation of the paper *Towards Sparse Hierarchical Graph Classifier* tested on Enzymes, D&D, Proteins and Collab datasets using Tensorflow 2.0.
